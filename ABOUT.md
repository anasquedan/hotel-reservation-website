  Application is easy to use without any need to mention steps to follow
 
 Technologies used: 
 Java : it's the language that I've working on for almost 2 years.
 Struts2: Simplifies creating web projects on java platform/ Easy to use, well-known frame-work, simpler than Spring frame-work.
 Jersey: Standard API for rest apps. 
 Bootstrap: most common library for css.  
 
 I've started this application to do it using servlet and jsp. But I moved to use new technologies like struts and jersey. 
 I don't have that good experience in them. But, I tried to learn more and more until being familiar with them. I've also used bootstrap, css, jqueryUI, html, JSP, to create beautiful website.
